Covid-19 in India Data Visualization

Dataset: The data has been collected from various sources such as Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, covid19india.org and few online articles and resource. This data was summarized and downloaded from Kaggle.

Hypothesis/assumptions: The assumption is that this data is accurate and takes into account the entire population of India and how the Covid-19 outbreak has affected it.

Goals: The goal of this project is to analyze different facts about how this pandemic has affected India:

•	When these cases began

•	Cases in relation to the population

•	Rural population vs urban population

•	Affected Age group

•	Testing in different parts of the country

•	Gender most affected

As cases of Covid-19 continue to rise across the globe, so has data associated with it. This includes information on the number of affected patients, the number of people they are likely to infect, equipment that is available for healthcare workers, as well as the death and recovery rates, among others.
With the rapid spread in the novel corona-virus across countries, we are getting data from various sources, visualizing the data can help explain the developing events in a clear and succinct way for people to interpret data well, tease out patterns, and pick up on trends.
India implemented a strict 21-day lockdown on March 24th when the total confirmed coronavirus cases in India were around 500. 

Here I perform an exploratory analysis of the Covid-19 situation in India.
